The functions in program:

using mplayer:
play all types of audio/video, load subtitles, play videos from youtube(parsing is not work anymore, i don't update the code from 2012).
convert audio/video files with ffmpeg.


this program is a interface for mplayer, i made this in visual studio using VB.Net and c#.Net, and some libraries in c/c++ like ffmpeg.

the comments in code most part is portuguese, sorry for that.

if you like can make a fork or someting...
